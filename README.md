Our model comprises four stages: Stage 1 involves the construction of the interaction, functionally complementary, and semantic graphs; Stage 2 performs cross-view graph contrastive learning (CVGCL); Stage 3  performs cross-modal graph contrastive learning (CMGCL); and Stage 4 carries out model prediction.
