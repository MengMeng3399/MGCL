# Multi-level Graph Contrastive Learning for Cold-start Recommendation in Mashup Development
⭐ This code has been completely released ⭐

⭐ Overall framework of the MGCL model. Our model comprises four stages: Stage 1 involves the construction of the interaction, functionally complementary, and semantic graphs; Stage 2 performs cross-view graph contrastive learning (CVGCL); Stage 3  performs cross-modal graph contrastive learning (CMGCL); and Stage 4 carries out model prediction ⭐
